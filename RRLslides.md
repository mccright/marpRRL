### Notes  
<a name="note1"></a><a href="#note1">NOTE1</a>: There are issues of race, caste, class and/or religious stereotypes and related derogatory terms in the telling of this story.  In some of these stories, the author assumes the *rightness* of colonialization or of the Christian faiths and uses that assumption to justify a broad spectrum of inhumane behaviors. It is LibriVox's policy to record texts as written. This book may be hurtful to some.
