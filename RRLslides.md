The Diamond Age or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.  By Neal Stephenson  1995  
### The Diamond Age or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age  
By [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson)  
Published 1995  
Summary:  
..."nanotechnology made nearly anything possible, and so the cultural role in deciding what *should* be done with it had become far more important than imagining what *could* be done with it." (page 37)  This book [covers a lot of territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age).  Written in the early 1990s, Stephenson created a world in the 3rd or 4th decade of the 21st century where nanotechnology had changed *everything* and humanity was characterized by extreme tribalism.

The Wright Brothers. By David McCullough. 2015  
### The Wright Brothers.  
By [David McCullough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McCullough) (July 7, 1933 â€“ August 7, 2022)

Readers Notes:  Author David McCullough describes the unique, courageous brothers, Wilbur and Orville Wright, who did the science, engineering, and construction leading to the first powered, heavier-than-air machine to achieve controlled, sustained flight with a pilot aboard on December 17, 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.  McCullough carries the story through the brother's *perfection* of their machine and its marketing to a sometimes flight-crazed world, their efforts to protect their patents -- all the while providing context by weaving in the brother's family life.
